She cried hysterically and uncontrollably calling for her mom. Her tiny frame lost balance as the coffin went into the ground. Emlin’s older brother Shaulin, tried to hold back and be strong but it was all to much as he also broke down. De Kock was described by her family as a “sunflower” who always saw the best in people. Meanwhile the 50-year-old suspect accused of murdering De Kock on Wednesday pleaded not guilty in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court. Clayton Andrews is facing charges of murder. The suspect fled to Eldorado Park but was later arrested. The State denied Andrews bail and identified him as a flight risk. Magistrate Thandi Theledi ordered Andrews to remain in police custody. The matter was remanded to next week. De Kock’s murder was just one of many such killings over the past few weeks. Pretoria News
