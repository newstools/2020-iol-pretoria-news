The Pretoria News paid a visit to new mothers at the Tshwane District Hospital. Nthabiseng Mayaba, a 24-year-old mother of two, said she named her daughter Boitumelo which means “joy” because that’s exactly what she brought to the family. Her daughter was the second one delivered at the hospital at 5:55am. “The labour pains were all worth it because all I have in my heart now is joy in my heart,” she said. Another mother of two, Mpho Moganedi, 28, named her son Musa because she said her pregnant journey was not an easy one. “It is through God’s will that I delivered this healthy baby boy. I am overly joyed and this is a great way to kick off the year,” she said. Gauteng MEC for Health Dr Bandile Masuku congratulated mothers of new-born babies and emphasised the importance of breast-feeding, especially in the early months. He also thanked the department’s health workers who had worked throughout the holiday period. In Limpopo, 74 new year’s babies were welcomed between midnight and 6am yesterday, with 25 at provincial hospitals in North West.
