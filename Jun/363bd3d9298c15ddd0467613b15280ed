He said President Cyril Ramaphosa was influenced by white people which was why he opened the economy. He pleaded with the crowd to avoid alcohol because it was killing young black lives while rich white people benefited from that. Wearing a black shirt with the words "I cant breathe", Malema said the spirit of George Floyd would breathe through them. "We will stand here and mingle for an hour and play music because Americans pretended not to hear when George said he could not breathe. Today they are going to hear him," he said. People should be aware of white people spreading the "better black" narrative, he added. He said that was the way white people wanted to separate black people and that it promoted xenophobia. Malema told the crowd not to listen to Ramaphosa and buy alcohol, but to continue to take instruction from the World Health Organization. * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #Coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visitÂ sacoronavirus.co.za  Pretoria News
