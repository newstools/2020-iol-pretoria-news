Bring on the sunshine. After months in lockdown and the worst of winter behind us, it is time to get out and exercise within the confines of our current reality.The popular SPAR Womenâ€™s Challenge is the latest mass event to go virtual in line with restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19. Instead of the usual 5km and 10km events which take place across the country, this year there will be one event on September 26 and women who would usually take part in the various city events have been asked to #BeSunshine by taking part in a national Virtual Challenge. Be the sunshine, share the light and spread the joy! ðŸŒž ðŸŒž Share your sunshine with us! How do you insprire people in these unusual times?#BeSunshine #SPARVirtualChallenge pic.twitter.com/u7xQMU6wlP To participate, women can run or walk any distance between 5km and 10km at any time between 6am and 6pm on the day and share online their experiences using the hashtags #SPARVirtualChallenge and #BeSunshine. SPAR Group marketing executive Mike Prentice said this year would have marked 30 years of the groupâ€™s involvement in womenâ€™s road running and he hoped this yearâ€™s event would give women something to look forward to, and provide a motive to get out and exercise. The theme colour is yellow, which symbolises happiness and positivity, a tonic for the dark days we have experienced recently.An important part of the campaign is the support the event gives to survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) through money raised from the R50 entry fee. Entrants also receive a race T-shirt, buff and a race magazine.
