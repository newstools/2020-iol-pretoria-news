The National Zoological Garden in Pretoria has welcomed the birth of a male southern giraffe calf. The birth in the giraffe enclosure last month was witnessed by zoo staff. A video was made and shows the mother deliver the calf, while the male giraffe stays close by. The giraffe is the tallest land mammal and gives birth standing up. The calf emerged front legs first and falls to the ground at birth, But with some nudges within half an hour it is standing up. The calf was moved to a boma area as it was not getting sufficient feed from its mother. A stomach intubation was conducted to allow the calf to obtain colostrum obtained from cowâ€™s milk and it spent two weeks in the boma before it was reintroduced into the enclosure and the adult giraffe. The zoo said the calf has grown quickly and weights over 106kg and drinks between 10-14 litres of milk per day. It can be viewed by visitors to the zoo. The southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa), also known as two-horned giraffe, is native to Southern Africa.
