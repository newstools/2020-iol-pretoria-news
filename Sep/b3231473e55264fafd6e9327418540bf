The Tshwane University of Technology’s Soshanguve South campus remained continued yesterday, with students unhappy about allowances, among other issues. Student Representative Council (SRC) president Khaya Mlangeni accused the institution of withholding allowances for accommodation and not recognising the plight of those who had not received funds for five months. “Some are struggling because of ‘no off-campus allowance’ and you find the institution saying they must live in internal residences. If they are full they must go to accredited residences, and only if those are full must they then go to leased residences. “What happens to those who have got no space anywhere and were forced to move to leased residences, but have received no funds? “These are struggling students most from far-flung areas, now being chased from these leased places because payment has not been forthcoming. “It is frustrating. How will students perform while being burdened with the stress of not knowing where they will stay?” His deputy Blessing Lebokollane said many students were suffering and the cycle would continue if these issues were not properly ironed out. “We tried to engage with management and they showed us serious arrogance. We are still continuing with the shutdown until our demands are heard,” said Lebokollane. University spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said it was important to note that the information was widely communicated to students and the public that university owned, leased and accredited residences should first be occupied before private accommodation would be considered for allowances. “It is also important to note that since the start of 2020, the university has adequate owned, accredited and leased accommodation available, therefore there was no longer a need for students to reside in non-accredited, private accommodation.”
