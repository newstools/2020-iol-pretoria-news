AFTER five months, most of the community libraries in Tshwane are set to open to the reading public on Monday. And it is not only avid readers who cannot wait: the librarians and other staff have been hard at work preparing to welcome back their members. The opening of a few libraries, notably Alkantrant and Glenstantia in region 6, has been delayed, but the City hopes it will not be long before they meet Covid-19 compliance requirements and are able to reopen. In the mean time, members are welcome to use another library or the provincial e-books platform, OverDrive to borrow a digital title. In addition to the main Es’kia Mphahlele Library at Sammy Marks Square, the following libraries will be open from Monday to Friday from 9am to 4pm: Hammanskraal and Temba (region 2); Atteridgeville, New Atteridgeville, Saulsville, Mountain View, Brooklyn, Mayville, Moot and Waverley (region 3); Eldoraigne, Irene, Valhalla, Olievenhoutbosch (region 4); and East Lynne (region 5). A spokesperson for the City of Tshwane said that only 30%  of study space and 10% of ICT use was permissable at this level of lockdown, and only at libraries like the main  library which have separate study areas. - Staff Reporter
