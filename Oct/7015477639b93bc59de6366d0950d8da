Staff Reporter IT has taken about 10 years, 2 500 flying hours over 370 000km across four countries for an aerial photographic essay showing off southern Africa as never seen before. Flying in their specially modified aircraft, aerial photographers Jay and Jan Roode have spent more than decade photographing some of the most remote and spectacular wilderness areas of southern Africa from above. The result is Aerial Art:  a vibrant collection of wild and enchanting images. Africa has always held an irresistible allure and fascination for the Roodes, and their images convey an intimacy with, and reverence for, the wilderness that reflects their passion for the conservation and preservation of the enthralling landscapes they have encountered. This is not just another coffee table book of wildlife photographs but a deeper and more artistic look into the varied landmass that makes up southern Africa; taking in sand-swept desert scenes to isolated villages, mountain ranges and estuaries. Two editions are available: a standard edition, at R980; and numbered limited edition at R1 960, from select bookstores as well as www.hphpublishing.co.za. Both editions have a magnetic clip hardcover case, 65 double-page spreads as well as a comprehensive index with a thumbnail of each image and a brief description at the back of the book. The Roodes’ photographs have been widely published in magazines, including Africa Geographic, National Geographic Traveller, GEO, BBC Wildlife, Nature’s Best Photography, CNN, Wild Travel and United Nations Environment Programme publications. Today they continue documenting Africa from the air and offer bespoke aerial safaris, taking visitors to unique locations they have discovered on their travels.
