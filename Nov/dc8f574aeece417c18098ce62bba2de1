Pretoria - The City of Tshwane is in a tight race against mother nature in its bid to repair sinkholes in Centurion. According to the SA Weather Service, residents of Gauteng should brace themselves for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Senior weather forecaster Bransby Bulo said they could see developments in the southern Gauteng areas, and citizens should be more vigilant and careful from tonight. Bulo said: “It might be difficult to drive and for pedestrians who walk in places that are near rivers. Pedestrians should also be vigilant as the rivers might be overflowing.” In Centurion, the presence of dolomite, most likely activated by heavy rains, has caused the recent sinkholes and could trigger more with the expected heavy rain. “One eyesore and potentially dangerous sinkhole is on the corner of Clifton Avenue and Potgieter Road, Centurion,” Bulo said. The heavily dolomitic area has been plagued by sinkholes. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo acknowledged the weather threat. He said delays in fixing of the sinkholes were related to procurement issues which were being sorted out or attended to. “The tender process is taking longer than usual due to internal issues which the City is working tirelessly to resolve,” Mashigo said. Although he said the metro was on track with planned repairs, there were around 10 new sinkholes which now required attention. Other sinkholes which had been repaired include those on 4th Avenue in Laudium; the Jean Avenue and Gerhard Street intersection in Die Hoewes; Poplar and Kameeldoring streets in Clubview; 2 Len Beyers Drive in Pierre van Ryneveld; Erf 1074 Second Avenue in Claudius; 561 Eli Street and on the corner of Eli and Bodenstein streets in Erasmia.
