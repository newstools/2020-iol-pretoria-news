Pretoria – MMC for Human Settlements Mpho Mehlape-Zimu has accused former Tshwane administrators of failing to ensure a proper land assessment was done before temporary homes were built in Mamelodi to accommodate hostel dwellers during Covid-19. The units were commissioned by national government and launched by Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu and former Tshwane administrators in May to address the de-densification of the hostels. A total of 1 000 homes were to be commissioned by the national government and built at a cost of R64 000 each, but the number was reduced to 668 during lockdown. Mehlape-Zimu said 223 were complete and 444 were at various stages of completion. During a visit to the site, she discovered the houses were built on a wetland without the provision of adequate storm water support and no proper land assessment was done beforehand. “Some of the units were built with defects. I intend to ensure that my housing team will look into addressing the defects and draw up a plan that will provide a lasting solution for the residents of Mamelodi hostel to support de-densification.” Mehlape-Zimu instituted strict deadlines for building the homes, saying she wanted to provide the community with feedback as soon as possible. She said: “The budget has been assigned and work is ongoing at these units, thus the commitment made to these residents must be delivered upon so that fruitless expenditure is not incurred.”
