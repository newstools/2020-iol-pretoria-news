This was according to ward councillor Shaun Wilkinson, who said everything that had been discussed to deal with criminals who have terrorised cyclists and visitors in the reserve needed to be co-ordinated. He said the plans should be executed this year, or criminals would win the war. He said that since security efforts were increased after meetings late last year, criminals had been moving out of the reserves. The private security companies tasked with ensuring safety had made numerous arrests. “There are arrests that were made by the guys providing security services and that’s great, but now we need to come together and actually start implementing what was discussed. “It’s all well and good when we consult all the role players and everyone says what they’re going to do, but until we get that done this nature reserve will never be safe. “That’s why I say things have got better, but I still maintain that cyclists and visitors must be very cautious when going to the reserves. “We don’t want to have people thinking it’s all good. We are still talking with everyone, including the City of Tshwane,” he said. Wilkinson will be hosting public participation meetings in Groenkloof on January 29 and 31 where residents can contribute their ideas to improve safety and security in the community. Stakeholders will also have an opportunity to discuss starting to co-ordinate all the plans and executing them so criminals are made to fear targeting innocent people in the facility. Pretoria News
