She said they ran one of the biggest campaigns for World Read Aloud Day according to LitWorld which is an international NPO addressing global literacy. Community and Social Development Services MMC Sakkie Du Plooy said it was important to get children in libraries and thought this was the best way to do it. He sent a message to children that they should come to libraries often and explore new worlds through books and become leaders with vast knowledge. “Our children are so used to social media that they don't always read. Libraries are there for books and are used for students who come here to study and we are very happy that they were able to extend the usage of the library,” he said. He said the library was always quiet and he loved that children that came for the important event and had fun while learning. Pretoria News
