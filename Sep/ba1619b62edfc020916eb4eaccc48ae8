Nationally, less than 1 000 new coronavirus cases were recorded in the country on Monday, according to a statement from Health Minister Zweli Mkhize. As of yesterday, the cumulative number of detected Covid-19 cases is 650 749, with 956 new cases identified, he said. The total number of Covid-19-related deaths is15 499 while the recovery rate is 88.9%. Since the 22nd of August we have reported under 3 000 cases a day – at the height of the epidemic during the month of July we would report anything between 10 000 and 15 000 cases a day. ’’Supporting this decline is also a demonstrable decline in persons under investigation, general ward admissions, ICU admissions, deaths and excess deaths. ’’Consistency across these indicators reassures us that indeed we are in the midst of a trough in the pandemic,’’ Mkhize said. There are growing calls to ease the last of the lockdown and hopes President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce changes this week. Mkhize said: ’’Whatever decisions are made, it is important to emphasise that the risk of spreading and contracting Covid-19 still remains and that non-pharmaceutical interventions remain important as we learn to co-exist with the coronavirus.’’
