The fraudsters advertise properties to rent at attractive rates and in excellent locations to lure victims, particularly students. Adverts appear to be genuine, with photos and contact details. The dodgy landlords trick victims into handing over money as a holding fee, a deposit or the first month's rent even before the prospective tenant has viewed the house or flat. The fraudsters pressure students by telling them the property is in high demand and will be off the market soon if they don’t act fast. Pretoria Central Police Station spokesperson Captain Augustinah Selepe said there were two types of crooks; those who roam the city looking for victims and others who advertise online. Selepe said if prospective landlords wanted to meet, students should insist on meeting at a police station. If parents or students suspect foul play they should alert police. When contacted the owner or agent generally asks the applicant to fill in an application form and supply various documents. All seems above board, but the wheels rapidly come off when the advertiser starts demanding an application fee plus a deposit to secure the property before a viewing. Steve van Wyk, managing director of Seeff Centurion, urged people seeking rental accommodation to start timeously. “Desperation may lead to hasty decisions and short-cuts or may force you to settle for a place that you either don’t like or can’t afford.” He said a major red flag was when a landlord or agent asked for a non-refundable deposit to secure the property before a viewing or before the agent or landlord has met them.
