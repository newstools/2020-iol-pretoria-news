Speaking during a studio session, Wakhe said that he and Poponkie could not contain their excitement to finally have a place they could call home. The duo shared the challenges they faced living with friends or family members. “We are grateful to Nthite for the caring and selflessness he showed us. This house will change our life for the better as with the money we get from doing piece jobs the possibility of owning a brick house seemed impossible.” Wakhe further said that their luck had changed for the best and as a token of appreciation they felt it was only right to pay tribute to Nthite the best way they know how, through song and dance.
